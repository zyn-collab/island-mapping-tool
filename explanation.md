Here’s the plain-English note you can ship with the build.

# What this tool is

A simple, open link that lets anyone add a pinned note on a map with the exact coordinates. You tap once, see your location, add a category, a short note, and a photo if you have one. That’s it. Each entry goes to your spreadsheet for review. Nothing is shown publicly in the tool.

# What people can add

Businesses and public services. Contacts and opening hours. Price checks for staple goods. Pharmacy stock for common medicines. Streetlights that work or don’t. Shade trees, benches, bins, open drains, potholes, road depressions, flood spots, mosquito breeding sites. Wheelchair access and other accessibility details. Internet speed. Water and air test notes. PSIP project progress photos. Even very fine-grained things like every motorcycle or every tree on a street, if someone wants to be that thorough.

# Why it matters

Small islands often lack a clear directory. Knowing what exists and where it sits unlocks decisions. A woman thinking about a bakery, tailoring, or a salon can check the map and see gaps, foot traffic notes, and nearby demand. A shop on a small island can plan delivery by naming a trusted handover at the ferry jetty and logging proof steps. Parents can find which nearby island has a dentist, an optometrist, or a pharmacy with insulin in stock. Councils can flag fixes for road edges, drains, and lighting with exact points, not vague complaints. Health teams can see where standing water clusters. Central government can read an island-by-island picture of needs rather than guesses.

# How you will use the data

Every new pin lands in your sheet with coordinates, category, note, and photo links. You and your team clean the text, standardize labels, and merge into your GIS. From there you can make service maps, gap heatmaps, delivery routes, and briefing pages for councils and ministries. You can also publish small “what’s new” maps back to communities or share a link to a filtered view for partners.

# What this enables in practice

* **Business planning**. Show where bakeries, bookshops, salons, hardware, cafés, and groceries exist or do not. Use gaps to justify new shops, with photos and prices as proof.
* **Women’s enterprise**. Surface low-barrier ideas and show demand. Map places open late, safe routes, and step-free entries.
* **Delivery networks**. Log speedboat and cargo contacts, days of week, and a named person who receives items at the jetty with a photo note.
* **Social services**. Point to DV shelters, family centres, disability services, speech therapy, and reproductive health rooms. People can find the nearest help fast.
* **Public fixes**. Pin potholes, tripping hazards, broken drains, dark zones, and flood spots with photos. Councils can track resolution.
* **Health basics**. Track pharmacy stock for common meds and insulin cold chain. Track clinic hours and on-island services.
* **Affordability**. Price a short basket for families. Rice, flour, oil, sugar, milk, canned tuna, diapers, formula, pads, LPG, water.
* **Access for all**. Record curb ramps, step-free entrances, handrails, marked crossings, benches with shade, and accessible toilets.
* **Digital access**. Log downlink, uplink, and ping to Malé at common spots.
* **Environment**. Water pH and TDS notes. Air particulates, heat, and noise snapshots.
* **PSIP transparency**. Photo progress at the work site today, with the exact pin.

# Who can use it

Anyone with the link. Council staff on their rounds. CSO partners. Teachers on the way home. Shop owners between customers. Youth groups and volunteers. No login. No training needed. Add a point, write a note, snap a photo, submit.

# Tone and norms

This is not a complaint wall. It is a shared log of what exists, what works, and what needs care. Keep notes factual and brief. Photograph public spaces and businesses. Avoid private yards and faces without consent.

# What it is not

It is not a public map or social feed. It does not show other people’s pins. It does not do user accounts. It does not try to manage projects. It is only a fast data entry door that feeds your dataset.

# Why coordinates matter

Street names and directions are messy on islands. A pinned point gives exact truth. You can match it with ferry timetables, price changes, flood lines, and service catchments later. It saves time, cuts debate, and helps you act.
